# Getting Started

Before you can begin building your own remote experiment, follow these steps to access and edit your selected experiment.

## 1. Accessing Your Experiment

After logging in with your GitHub account, you will be directed to a window where you can edit the experiment you have selected. Only experiments for which you have been granted permission as a collaborator will be accessible.

## 2. Creating Your Experiment

To start building your remote experiment, follow the on-screen instructions provided by Virtual Labs. You will be guided through the process step by step, entering the relevant information for each part of your experiment, such as its aim, theory, references, and more. Think of it as filling out different sections or pieces of information that make up your experiment.

## 3. Upload Media

Within the Virtual Labs CMS, you can upload media files, such as images, which can be used in different components of your experiment, like the Aim or Theory. To upload media files, follow these steps:

### Navigation Bar

In the Navigation Bar at the top of the CMS page, click on the "Media" button. This will open a pane specifically designed for managing your media files.

### Media Pane

After clicking the "Media" button, a pane will appear where you can view and manage your uploaded media files. This pane allows you to organize and conveniently use images within your experiment.

### Uploading Media Files

To upload a new media file, look for an "Upload" or "Add" button within the Media Pane. Click on this button, and a file explorer window will appear, allowing you to select the image file you wish to upload. Once you've chosen the file, click "Open" or a similar button to start the upload process.

### Managing Uploaded Media Files

After uploading, you will see the newly added image displayed in the Media Pane. You can view, organize, and manage your media files from this pane. Some options for managing your media files may include renaming, deleting, or moving them to specific folders, depending on the features provided by Virtual Labs.
