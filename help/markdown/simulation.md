# Uploading Simulations

In Virtual Labs, each experiment contains simulations, which are computer-based tools that allow students and researchers to simulate real-world laboratory experiments in a virtual environment. Simulations consist of various files, including HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript code, and images.

To upload these simulation files, follow these steps:

1. Collection Pane: After logging in, you will see a Collection pane on the left side of the page. This pane contains tabs representing different folders related to simulations, such as Simulation, Simulation CSS, Simulation JS, and Simulation Images.

2. Select Tab: Click on the tab that corresponds to the type of file you want to upload. For example, if you want to upload a CSS file for the simulation, click on the Simulation CSS tab.

3. Upload Card: In the center of the page, you will find a card labeled "Upload <TAB NAME>". Click on this card to open the upload screen.

4. File List Widget: The upload screen will display a file list widget. This widget shows the files currently present in the selected folder.

5. Add File: To add a new file, click on the "Add File +" button in the file list widget. This will add a new file widget to the list.

6. Media Asset Pane: Click on the file widget that you just added. This will open the "Media Asset" pane, which is linked to the respective folder (simulation, CSS, JS, or images). The "Media Asset" pane provides options for managing your files.

7. Upload File: In the "Media Asset" pane, click on the "Upload" button to select a file from your local system and upload it to the corresponding folder.

8. Additional Options: The "Media Asset" pane also offers additional options such as downloading a selected file, copying the file path, or deleting the selected file if needed. These options allow you to manage your simulation files effectively.

Repeat these steps for each file you want to upload, ensuring that you select the appropriate tab and follow the same process for each file type (HTML, CSS, JS, or images).

Remember to save your changes and ensure that all the simulation files are successfully uploaded to the appropriate folders.

By following these steps, you can easily upload simulation files to the Virtual Labs platform and enhance the virtual laboratory experience for users.
