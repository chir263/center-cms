# Editing Experiment Components

In Virtual Labs, you have the ability to edit the different components of your experiment, such as the Aim, Theory, and more. By customizing these components, you can provide detailed information and instructions to enhance the learning experience for the users. To edit experiment components, follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Aim** card: On the main page of the experiment, you will find a section displaying various components of the experiment. Locate the **Aim** card and click on it. This will redirect you to a page with two sections.

2. Editing Interface: On the redirected page, you will see two sections. The left pane contains a Markdown editor, while the right pane displays a preview of the edited content. The Markdown editor allows you to write and format text using simple syntax.

3. Editor Functionality: Most of the editor functionalities are straightforward and intuitive. You can use basic Markdown syntax to format your text, such as adding headings, creating lists, emphasizing text, and more. You can refer to Markdown cheat sheets or guides for more advanced formatting options.

4. Inserting Images: To insert an image into your Aim component, click on the **+** button in the editor. This will open a pop-up menu with two options: **Image** and **Code Block**. Click on the **Image** option to insert an image into your Aim section. You can then provide the image URL or choose an image from your uploaded media assets.
